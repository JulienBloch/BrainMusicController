# BrainMusicController for CalHacks 4.0
# Authors: Julien Bloch, Ashton Teng, Julie Deng, Aditya Palacharla

## Inspiration
Want to empower people, especially those who cannot use their hands, to take control of their music by using their brain waves

## What it Does
Controls music playback via blinking and brain wave changes
Blinking twice in succession will pause/play the current song, and changing brain waves between a calm/excited state will switch you into a calm/excited playlist, respectively.

## How did you Make It
- The Muse headset was used to collect EEG and EMG data from the head via four electrodes on the forehead.
- Data from the Muse is streamed real time to the Muse Monitor app, which then streams it via WiFi to a specific IP and port via UDP and OSC.
- A computer listens in on the port and receives the EEG data via the python package python-osc. Specifically, we receive information from each of the four electrode on the raw EEG trace data, and five frequency bands - alpha, beta, theta, gamma, and delta waves, which are associated with different brain states.
- The real time streaming EEG and frequency data is formatted as Python Deque which keeps a fixed size memory of 3 seconds of data. The memory is read every second to determine whether there was a blink or a brain state change.
- A blink is registered when the raw EEG signal from the appropriate electrodes register a drop of sufficient magnitude, followed by a return to baseline, followed by a similar drop. This is tested in a scrolling window to register when the user blinks twice in succession.
- An ordinary least squares binary classifier determines whether the userâ€™s eyes are open or closed. The weights for the classifier were generated from running OLS on tens of thousands of data points and can be calibrated for individuals with a single scan (code provided). A three second scrolling window determines whether the user purposely changed their eyes to open or closed.

## Challenges we ran into
- Gathering non-noise EEG data is considerably difficult. We tried both the OpenBCI Ganglion and the Muse, which a variety of software packages and APIs. In the end we found reliable eye blink and simple brain state change from calm/alert signal with the Muse.
- Streaming data from Muse to Python is difficult due to little developer support from Muse. We tried a variety of possible mediums to transmit data - over WiFi, over Bluetooth. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
-Collected, transmitted, processed, and classified reliable eye blink and brain stage signals. Reliability is arguably the biggest challenge in building brain computer interfaces.

## What we learned
-Reading EEG is complicated and inconsistent
-How to implement Spotify API

## What's next for BrainMusicController
Adding new functionalities such as being able to sort songs that you listen to into playlists based on emotions, which will be determined using EEG.
